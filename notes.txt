the small javascript code presents two problems:
Tight coupling: it means changes made in html could have major consequnces in javascript
Low Cohesion:  a function in javascript executes several operations that are not directly related to the function

the correct procedure for software programming are:
Loose Coupling: every component should be independent of other and changes made in one should not directly imply changes in other
High cohesion: every method in a component should steak to just execute the disired operation without executing any other line of code

npm install angular@1.8.2: this is the command I used to install ANGULAR FOR THIS PROJECT
